Missing Backend Implementation
What's Missing for Live API Integration:
API Route Handlers

No route.ts files in src/app/api/
Referenced endpoints (/api/razorpay/order, /api/email/send) don't exist
Database Connection

Mongoose installed but no connection configuration
No database models or schemas
AI Service Integration

No OpenAI, Anthropic, or other AI service integration
No environment variables for AI API keys
Authentication

No auth system implemented
No user management
Email Service

Resend package installed but not configured
No email templates or sending logic

Recommendations for Live API Integration
To implement actual backend functionality:

Create API Routes

// src/app/api/chat/route.ts
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  // Implement AI chat logic
}
Add Environment Variables

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
MONGODB_URI=your_connection_string
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_key
Implement Database Models

User management
Chat history
Component usage analytics
Integrate AI Services

OpenAI GPT integration
Streaming response handling
Context management
Conclusion
The MVP Blocks App is a sophisticated frontend component library with a well-designed AI assistant interface, but lacks any live backend API integration. All AI functionality is currently simulated with mock data and demo responses. The codebase is well-structured and ready for backend integration, with the necessary dependencies already installed but not implemented.

The app serves as an excellent foundation for a component library with the potential to add real AI capabilities through proper backend implementation.
